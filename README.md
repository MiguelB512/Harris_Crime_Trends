# Houston Area Crime
Final project for Rice Bootcamp, analyzing crime data in the Greater Houston area

## Project Goals
With Houston being such a large city, we wanted to take a look at crime statistics and see if we could compare how election years, counties, and other factors may determine the crime numbers for different counties. 

Some questions we wanted to try and answer are:
- What are the crime rates for the Houston area?
- What crimes are trending/increased over the past couple years?
- Was there a drop in crime, or an increase in crime during the Covid-10 Pandemic?
- Can predictions be made about which crimes are more predominant during certain times of the year? Or if there is another pandemic what prediction can be made about crime?
